Banking Dataset Classification.

Predicting if the client will subscribe to a term deposit

There has been a revenue decline in the Portuguese Bank and they would like to know what actions to take. 
After investigation, they found that the root cause was that their customers are not investing enough for long term deposits. 
So the bank would like to identify existing customers that have a higher chance to subscribe for a long term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such customers.

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. 
Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed
https://www.kaggle.com/rashmiranu/banking-dataset-classification  :- This is the link where I had taken the dataset in which variables are systematically defined.

I had used CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREE, and predict that the product would subscribed the term deposite or not. Here two case arises in my project where the model
is overfitting the dataset, then I had used pruning process to overcome this overfitting model.
And find out the best model prediction.
